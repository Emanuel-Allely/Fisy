# Step 2 - Introduction

Discover the general method for making financial tables with FISY

Once the FISY tool has been downloaded, we recommend that you start by reading the ‚ÄúGuide‚Äù tab which will detail the general operation of the tool. This is a step that will go a long way in helping you understand how to do your financial tables for your business plan! This tab is very complementary to the content of this page.

Very briefly, FISY is very easy to use. Start by filling in the information tabs on your project (‚ÄúConfig‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù, ‚ÄúExternal charges‚Äù, ‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrders‚Äù and ‚ÄúCash‚Äù tabs), then analyze the results in the financial tables (‚Äú Synthesis ‚Äù,‚Äú Income statements ‚Äù,‚Äú Financing plan ‚Äù,‚Äú Balance sheets ‚Äù). An iterative approach to these phases will generally be necessary to then refine your project and financial plan.

# Step 3 - Configuration

Fill in the general information of your project in the "Config" tab

Now let's get to the heart of the matter by filling in general information about your project in the "Config" tab of FISY.

In particular, the tool will ask you to start by entering the start date of your business plan. Then you will have to fill in the different "activities" of your business: it is a question of specifying the sources of income that you will have (names, income, terms of delivery and payments, ...). For each of these activities, you will then have to specify the variable costs that you foresee (unit costs, etc.). Finally, the tool offers you to adjust certain "advanced configuration" parameters for the automatic construction of certain charges (fixed charges, salary charges, VAT, etc.).

As an example, we suggest you imagine launching an e-commerce activity selling socks and ties. In this example, we planned to have 2 ‚Äúactivities‚Äù, one selling a 2-pack of socks at ‚Ç¨ 20, and another selling a tie at ‚Ç¨ 30 each. For each, we will specify as variable costs unit costs of ‚Ç¨ 7 for socks and ‚Ç¨ 10 for ties for an average margin of around 66%. To keep it simple in this example, we will not specify any particular payment conditions, so FISY will automatically calculate receipts and payments to date. We also marginally adjust the amounts of external charges proposed by default to adjust them to the project.

# Step 4 - Personal

Fill in the information on your personnel costs in the "Personnel" tab

Next, let's fill in the information about forecasted personnel costs, which are very often one of the biggest expense items in a business.

FISY allows you to easily specify your personnel costs by entering the types of position, salary costs (gross salaries), and possibly the name of the person (if you already know them!). The tool will automatically calculate employer contributions, which will be integrated into the forecast tables. Note that FISY asks you to specify a monthly salary for the first 2 years, then per semester for the following years (for greater clarity). In the event of hiring forecasts exceeding the number of rows in the table, we advise you to group the same positions on one and the same row. In the ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù version of FISY you can also specify the CIR / CII rates per position.

In our example, we have specified the recruitments of several positions (manager, marketing, IT, logistics manager, logistics technician, etc.). Note that for logistics technicians, we planned in this example to increase their number according to the development of turnover, to ensure the logistics of orders! üôÇ We have therefore entered the following formula in the cells: ‚Ç¨ 2,000 x (Number of orders) / (10 * 8 * 20). We therefore budgeted a gross monthly salary of ‚Ç¨ 2,000 per technician and multiplied by a number of technicians which is proportional to the orders (assumption of 10 orders processed / hour, for 8 hours of daily work over 20 working days). This is obviously an estimate, which could be rounded up to the next unit, but we wanted to keep it simple in this example. The idea to remember is that to make a serious business plan, you can use Excel either with static figures, or sometimes also with functions such as this to make the tool dynamic according to your needs. assumptions (in particular of turnover).

# Step 5 - External loads

Fill in the information on your external charges in the "External charges" tab

The FISY tool invites us to subsequently fill in the information concerning your external expenses provided for in your business plan.

External charges correspond to the company's fixed charges related to its general operation. FISY automatically calculates fixed cost estimates for you, from the data entered in the "Config" tab and according to the turnover and personnel costs variables (see details in the config tab). This makes it possible to facilitate the calculation on these numerous expenditure items. We obviously invite you to adapt the amounts according to your project. You can also specify additional external charges below (in the clearer boxes), by specifying the names and forecast monthly amounts of these charges.

In our example of an e-commerce site, we have specified additional external expenses for IT management subcontracting of e-commerce (on the 1st year of activity, before hiring the IT manager) with a fixed budget of 2000 ‚Ç¨ / per month, as well as a web advertising budget which is calculated according to the number of orders (10 ‚Ç¨ on average of advertising costs / per order, with an estimate of 0.5 ‚Ç¨ of click cost and 5% of conversion). It seemed important to us to size the advertising budget as well (we could also do the opposite, by estimating the forecast revenues according to the budget, which amounts to the same thing).

# Step 6 - Investments

Fill in the information on your investments in the "Investments" tab

You can then specify your forecast investments in the tool.

Investments are charges that are amortized over several years, because they are generally linked to operation over several years. In FISY, enter a name, monthly investment amounts, and the amortization period for each investment. You can also specify whether the financing is by leasing, so that FISY automatically calculates the impact in your cash flow plan. Finally, you can also provide information on any contributions in kind.

In our example, we have only informed a few small investments related to the start of the activity: creation of the e-commerce site, creation of communication tools, natural referencing, and legal services. Obviously, we are on a somewhat simplistic example, and any financial business plan should generally provide for more precise investments over time.

# Step 7 - Orders

Fill in the information on your forecast sales in the "Orders" tab

We then come to the key step of building your revenue assumptions.

In the FISY tool, the turnover is calculated automatically from the information entered on the volume of monthly orders in the "Orders" tab and information on the unit prices in the "Config" tab. For each "activity" entered in the "Config" tab, you will then have to specify the forecast volumes of monthly orders in the "Orders" tab. Don't hesitate to use Excel's automatic calculation formulas to calculate your order growth.

In our example, we have therefore planned to order 200 packs of socks and 100 ties for the 1st month. For the following months, we have specified a formula that automatically calculates orders with the assumption of 20% monthly growth in year 1, then 10% in year 2, 3% in year 3, 2% in year 4 and 5.

# Step 8 - Cash flow

Fill in the information on financing and stocks in the "Treasury" tab

Finally, we have one last step left, with information on your financing and forecast stocks.

In the "Cash" tab of FISY, you can find a summary of many automatic calculations of cash receipts and disbursements. You will also be able to specify certain important data in this tab on the initial cash flow at start-up (if the 1st month of forecast does not correspond to the 1st month of operation of the company), on the planned financing (founding capital, investor capital, loans , grants, associates' current accounts, reimbursable advances, etc.), on the variation in forecast stocks, and on the conditions for reimbursing certain financing (current accounts, reimbursable advances, etc.).

In our example, we have planned a start-up with ‚Ç¨ 0 cash, a founding capital of ‚Ç¨ 50,000, additional financing in the 3rd month with an honorary loan (in current account) of ‚Ç¨ 50,000 + a bank loan of the same sum, and a small fundraising of 100,000 ‚Ç¨ in August that we would consider doing with business angels. We also budgeted for an increase in inventory based on orders, calculated on an inventory equivalent to 30% of monthly business volume.

# Step 9 - Financial tables

Analyze information on financial tables generated by FISY

You have now completed the intelligence part of the tool and you can analyze the results in the financial tables automatically generated by FISY.

The "Summary" tab will give you a good summary of the key points of analysis of your financial business plan. You will be able to analyze the evolution of your turnover and results, compare them with annual breakeven profitability points, and finally have a vision of the evolution of your forecast cash flow. Check here that your revenue and profitability forecasts are consistent and viable, and that your cash flow is still positive. You can deepen your analysis with the tabs ‚ÄúCash flow‚Äù, ‚ÄúIncome statements‚Äù, ‚ÄúFinancing plan‚Äù and ‚ÄúBalance sheets‚Äù. Feel free to then work iteratively, evolving your assumptions based on your analysis.

In our example, we can see that the company would develop favorably, despite a first year in deficit. It might be interesting to readjust personnel and investment costs upwards to be more careful and to confirm that the company remains profitable if necessary. We also note that the cash flow would remain positive in our example.

The "Income statement" tab gives you an income statement financial table automatically generated from the data you have entered. Very convenient! üôÇ Analyze in detail with this provisional income statement the potential performance of your business. For more information, read our article on the Income Statement.
The "Funding plan" tab gives you a funding plan also generated by FISY. For more information, read our article on the Financing Plan.
The "Balance sheets" tab generates (always automatically) the provisional balance sheets for your activity. For more information, read our article on the Balance Sheet.
